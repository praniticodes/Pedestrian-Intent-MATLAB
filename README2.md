# Pedestrian Intent Prediction - MATLAB Simulation

This project simulates pedestrian scenarios in unstructured environments using MATLAB's Driving Scenario Designer. It includes sensor integration and actor simulation.

## Files
- `design.m` - Auto-generated MATLAB script from the Driving Scenario Designer
- Other `.m` files - Control logic and simulation processing
- `.mat` or `.mlx` files - Scenario or sensor data (if any)

## Status
ðŸš§ Project is under development  
Sensor logic and pedestrian intent prediction integration is in progress.

## Future Goals
- Use sensor detections to stop the ego vehicle
- Add ML/DL intent prediction model
- Visualize outputs

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2024b or later
- Automated Driving Toolbox
